# Machine Learning Primitives

`nbml` is a small machine learning library built on top of NDArray, offering primitives suited to low-level ML algorithm development instead of a comfortable API of abstractions (for that see Burn). All this provides are primitives (Attention, LSTM, FFN, etc) and a small optimizer API that can integrate with any custom algorhtms written over the NDArray backend.
